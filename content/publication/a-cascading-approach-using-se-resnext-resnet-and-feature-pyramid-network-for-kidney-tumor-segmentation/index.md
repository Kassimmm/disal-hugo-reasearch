abstract: Accurate segmentation of kidney tumors in CT images is very important
  in the diagnosis of kidney cancer. Automatic semantic segmentation of the
  kidney tumor has shown promising results towards developing advance surgical
  planning techniques in the treatment of kidney tumor. However, the relatively
  small size of kidney tumor volume in comparison to the overall kidney volume,
  and its irregular distribution and shape makes it difficult to accurately
  segment the tumors. In addressing this issue, we proposed a coarse to fine
  segmentation which leverages on transfer learning using SE-ResNeXt model for
  the initial segmentation and ResNet and Feature Pyramid Network for the final
  segmentation. The processes are related and the output of the initial results
  was used for the final training. We trained and evaluated our method on the
  KITS19 dataset and achieved a dice score of 0.7388 and Jaccard score 0.7321
  for the final segmentation demonstrating promising results when compared to
  other approaches.
