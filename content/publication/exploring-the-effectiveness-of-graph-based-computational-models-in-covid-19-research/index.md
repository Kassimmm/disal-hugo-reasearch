abstract: The world has witnessed various scientific disciplinesâ€™ rapid growth
  and advancement, leading to groundbreaking discoveries and advances in
  multiple fields in recent years. One such field that has gained significant
  attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, is the application of
  graph theory techniques in studying the spread and mitigation of the virus. In
  this paper, we delve into the intricacies of graph theory and its utilization
  in analyzing COVID-19, shedding light on the innovative approaches researchers
  worldwide employ. Also, the study evaluates the various implementation of
  graph theories in spreading and controlling the virus using diverse datasets.
  The researchers retrieved several works in the COVID-19 and graph theory field
  from digital databases. However, studies deducted that GT approaches,
  algorithms and techniques offer insights into transmission hotspots, spread
  dynamics in social, control and mobility networking, vaccination optimization,
  evaluation of interventions and epidemic prediction, among other valuable
  findings. Limitations and future directions were also directed in the study.
