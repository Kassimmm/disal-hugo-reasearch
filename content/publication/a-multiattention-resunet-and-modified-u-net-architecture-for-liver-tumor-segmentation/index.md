abstract: "Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the
  world, and early diagnosis is important. However, the similarity in shape,
  texture, and intensity values between the liver, tumors, and other neighboring
  organs such as the heart, spleen, stomach, and kidneys often complicates
  visual differentiation. Manual identification of tumors in the liver is
  time-consuming, intricate, and susceptible to errors with potential
  repercussions for patient care. While machine learningâ€“based approaches have
  emerged for liver organ recognition and segmenting the tumor, they continue to
  face challenges related to recognition accuracy and the inability to
  distinguish tumors of varied sizes. To solve the problems, a multiattention
  network made up of cascaded ResUNet and U-Net with attention mechanisms was
  proposed in this study. We investigated liver tumor segmentation with various
  configurations of U-Net, ResUNet, U-Net with attention mechanisms, and ResUNet
  with attention mechanisms on augmented and nonaugmented data. We used the
  3Dircadb dataset for training and validation purposes, and the proposed method
  was evaluated on dice score, intersection of union (IoU), recall, and
  precision. The performance metrics achieved with this method on the dataset
  are as follows: approximately 0.89 for the dice coefficient, 0.90 for IoU,
  0.93 for recall, and 0.96 for precision in the case of liver segmentation
  without data augmentation and 0.92, 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94, respectively, for
  dice score, IoU, recall, and precision with data augmentation. For tumor
  segmentation, the metrics include 0.70 for dice coefficient, 0.61 for IoU,
  0.91 for recall, and 0.94 for precision when the data were augmented but 0.83
  for dice score, 0.78 for IoU, and 0.89 and 0.90, respectively, for recall and
  precision."
