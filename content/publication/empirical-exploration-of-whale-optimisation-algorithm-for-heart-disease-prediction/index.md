abstract: Heart Diseases have the highest mortality worldwide, necessitating
  precise predictive models for early risk assessment. Much existing research
  has focused on improving model accuracy with single datasets, often neglecting
  the need for comprehensive evaluation metrics and utilization of different
  datasets in the same domain (heart disease). This research introduces a heart
  disease risk prediction approach by harnessing the whale optimization
  algorithm (WOA) for feature selection and implementing a comprehensive
  evaluation framework. The study leverages five distinct datasets, including
  the combined dataset comprising the Cleveland, Long Beach VA, Switzerland, and
  Hungarian heart disease datasets. The others are the Z-AlizadehSani,
  Framingham, South African, and Cleveland heart datasets. The WOA-guided
  feature selection identifies optimal features, subsequently integrated into
  ten classification models. Comprehensive model evaluation reveals significant
  improvements across critical performance metrics, including accuracy,
  precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating
  characteristic curve. These enhancements consistently outperform
  state-of-the-art methods using the same dataset, validating the effectiveness
  of our methodology. The comprehensive evaluation framework provides a robust
  assessment of the model’s adaptability, underscoring the WOA’s effectiveness
  in identifying optimal features in multiple datasets in the same domain
