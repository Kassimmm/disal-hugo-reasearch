abstract: Over time, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has played a pivotal role
  in accurately delineating brain cancers, facilitating diagnostic processes for
  medical practitioners. However, the inherent subjectivity in human
  interpretation presents challenges, prompting the exploration of machine
  learning models to augment diagnostic guidance. Despite their advantages,
  these models can be susceptible to errors depending on their objectives. This
  study addresses segmentation errors induced by data capture noise by
  introducing the morphological fractional order Darwinian particle swarm
  optimization (M-FODPSO) approach. Leveraging classical discrete wavelet
  transform and principal component analysis, pertinent features are extracted
  from M-FODPSO outputs, subsequently trained on an ensemble classifier.
  Performance evaluation demonstrates an impressive accuracy of 97.03%, achieved
  with an average processing time of 1.7161 s, thereby showcasing enhanced tumor
  cell characterization compared to the classical FODPSO method. This approach
  effectively mitigates segmentation errors attributed to data noise,
  underscoring its potential for refining MRI-based brain cancer diagnosis.
