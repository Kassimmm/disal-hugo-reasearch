abstract: This study introduces an advanced framework for plant disease
  detection, specifically classifying tomato images into “Early Blight” and
  “Healthy” categories. Utilizing a fusion of artificial intelligence and
  computer vision, the research employs the MobileNet architecture enriched with
  custom convolutional layers for enhanced feature extraction. The model's
  adaptability to different dataset sizes highlights its robustness, with
  performance benchmarks indicating up to 100% accuracy using classifiers like
  Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting. The framework further leverages
  ensemble classifiers to refine prediction accuracy, addressing the real-world
  complexities of variable lighting and environmental conditions. In its
  entirety, the research offers a scalable, accurate, and systematic approach to
  automated plant disease detection, with implications for bolstering global
  food security and sustainable agriculture.
