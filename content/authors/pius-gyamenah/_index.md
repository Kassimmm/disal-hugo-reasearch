I have gained significant experience working in international and cross-functional teams to design solutions to problems in diverse fields such as finance, environment, education, and manufacturing. I am a lifelong learner guided by the principle of "Disce ut Doceas" (We learn to teach). I am passionate and dedicated to self-discovery, self-development, and service in humility. I strongly believe once we discover our true selves and develop them, we can transform society and the world around us by offering our talents and abilities in the form of simple service. Beyond my academic and professional background, I am also a "human being" with an active social life and a sense of humor. I believe in the principle of UBUNTU and HOPE (Helping Other People Excel)
